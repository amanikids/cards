      %p Education in Tanzania is meant to be free for children, but hidden mandatory fees make sending a child to school a luxury many families cannot afford. Only 54% of Tanzanian children finish elementary school and just 7% complete high school. By purchasing Amani Christmas Cards, you are making a difference in the lives of disadvantaged children.
      %p Each year the money raised through our Christmas card fundraiser directly funds Amani’s education program. Amani paid for tuition, uniforms, textbooks, and school lunches for nearly 300 Tanzanian children in 2009. Next year we hope to give even more children the opportunities that an education brings.
