= CacheableAssets

Simple glue code providing sane configuration for your static assets. (Probably
on Heroku[http://heroku.com/].)

* Far-future Cache-Control headers. (Courtesy Rack::StaticCache.)
* MD5-digest cache-busting strings written into the filepath. (Inspired by
  asset_fingerprint[http://github.com/eliotsykes/asset_fingerprint].)

== Install

Works with Rails 3. In your Gemfile:

 gem 'cacheable_assets', :require => 'cacheable_assets/railtie'

== Configure

The defaults should Just Work. But, if you're using Sass, you'll want to tweak
them:

 $ rails g cacheable_assets:initializer
